In this word guessing game, object oriented programming is used to create an interactive page for a user. The user is given a keyboard and 5 tries to guess the phrase. If the user loses all 5 lives before guessing the phrase, they are given the option to reset the game and try again.

I added background images to the initial screen as well as the win/loss screens. I had to edit the images to make them more opaque so the text could still be seen on top of the image. I also edited the h2 element to the font "Knockout" and added a shadow of 2px, 2px.
